The method deposit() expects you to supply an arbitrary amount of the <code>base_token</code>. As a result, it mints double the amount of the liquidity asset to the calling address. Analogously, if you call <code>withdraw()</code> supplying it with the liquidity asset, it will transfer half that amount of the <code>base_token</code> back to the calling address except for deducting it from the contract balance instead of minting it.</p><p>The first step towards interacting with any contract in the TypeScript SDK is using the <code>typegen</code> CLI utility to generate type-safe bindings for the contract methods:</p><div class="language-sh"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">sh</span><pre class="shiki material-theme-palenight" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FFCB6B;">$</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">npx</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">fuels</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">typegen</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">-i</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">./contract/out/debug/</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">*</span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">-abi.json</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">-o</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">./contract-types</span></span>
